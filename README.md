This repo contains my assignments for **CP104**, which is all about learning the basics of Python programming. In this class, I focused on understanding the fundamentals of Python, including:

- Python Syntax and Basic Constructs
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Lists
- File Handling
- Problem-Solving

The assignments helped me develop a solid foundation in Python, preparing me for more advanced topics and problem-solving in programming.
